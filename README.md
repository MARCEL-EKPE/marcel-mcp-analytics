# Marcellytics
 AI-powered backend analytics agent built with **NestJS** and **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. Query databases, generate insights, and automate tasks — all from natural language prompts.

**Marcellytics** is a backend service that turns natural language into real actions.  
It connects to a local API or database, runs analytics queries, and can even send email reports — all triggered through plain English instructions.

This project demonstrates how **MCP** can be used to bridge the gap between large language models (LLMs) and real-world backend operations.

## Features

-  **Prompt-based commands:** Ask questions in natural language — e.g., “Show me signups from this week.”
-  **Database analytics:** Run queries and return insights automatically.
-  **MCP-driven:** Fully compatible with CopilotKit or any MCP client.
-  **Email automation:** Generate and send summary reports directly from the backend.
-  **Modular and extensible:** Easily add more tools (e.g., Slack messages, external APIs, etc.)

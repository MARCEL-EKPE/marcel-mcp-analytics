# marcel-mcp-analytics
 An AI-powered backend service built with Nodejs/Nestjs and Model Context Protocol (MCP) that transforms natural language prompts into actionable insights.
# Marcellytics

 AI-powered backend analytics agent built with **NestJS** and **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. Query databases, generate insights, and automate tasks — all from natural language prompts.

**Marcellytics** is a backend service that turns natural language into real actions.  
It connects to a local API or database, runs analytics queries, and can even send email reports — all triggered through plain English instructions.

This project demonstrates how **MCP** can be used to bridge the gap between large language models (LLMs) and real-world backend operations.
